            %{carbon_impact_guidance} (opens in a new window). <br/>
            Carbon impact data comprises:
          para1_li1: Emissions from both the capital and operational stages of the whole-life investment.
          para1_li2: Emissions avoided as a result of reduced flood risk and impacts to properties over the whole-life investment as well as from any solutions that sequester carbon.
          para1_li3: A net calculation of emissions 1) minus 2) in tonnes CO2e over the whole-life investment period and monetised as an economic benefit for use in the Partnership funding calculator.

            <p>Capital emissions are the project carbon impact from the works that build or refurbish assets. They are calculated from quantities of resource used in building or refurbishing assets.</p>
            <p>To provide capital emissions for the Carbon impact data requires a supporting Carbon assessment and is a mandatory requirement for subsequent business cases.
