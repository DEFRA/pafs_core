        outcome_outside_project_lifetime: |
          The record will remain in draft. You cannot submit your project proposal, because
          the ‘Risks and properties benefitting’ data entered is outside the date range for
          your project. The date range is defined as being between your ‘Earliest Start Date’
          AND the financial year indicated in the ‘Last financial year the project will spend
          funds’ section. Please adjust one or more of those two values or the Outcome Metrics
          data in the ‘Risks and properties benefitting’ section, so that the Outcome Metrics
          data is within the project’s date range.
        funding_data_outside_project_lifetime: |
          The record will remain in draft. You cannot submit your project proposal, because the
          funding data entered is outside the date range for your project. The date range is
          defined as being between your ‘Earliest Start Date’ AND the financial year indicated in
          the ‘Last financial year the project will spend funds’ section. Please adjust one or
          more of those two values or the funding data in the ‘Funding sources and spending’
          section, so that the funding data is within the project’s date range.
        key_dates_outside_project_lifetime: |
          The record will remain in draft. You cannot submit your project proposal, because the
          date entered in the ‘Important Dates' section indicating when the project would
          ‘start achieving its benefits’ (i.e. Ready for Service date) is outside the date range for
          your project. The date range is defined as being between your ‘Earliest Start Date’ AND
          the financial year indicated in the ‘Last financial year the project will spend funds’
          section. Please adjust one or more of these three values so that the Ready for Service
          date is within the date range.
